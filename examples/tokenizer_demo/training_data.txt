Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<n>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore<n>
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<n>
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<n>
Tis some visitor, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door<n>
Only this and nothing more.<n>
